# Kalman-Filters
This repository contains my projects with Kalman Filters. This repository will be regularly updated with new stuff.

# Outlier Detection
In this implementation, Kalman Filter is used to process a signal to remove outliers (Disturbances and Noise) and produce a smooth signal.

# Sensor Data Fusion
In this implementation, Kalman Filter is used to produce pitch and roll values from 6-DOF IMU sensor(Accelerometer and Gyroscope) values. The current results are not very accurate, requires tuning.
